come to the play room so 
    the 2 min time starts + send first indice 
    the new 2 min time starts + send second indice 
    the new 2 min time starts + send 3rd indice 
    -------------------------------
    Now you need to take care of the priority of the buzzer
    if user clicks on the buzzer then :
            +a new timer will start for all 
            +the question timers will Stop for all 
            the app will excpect an answer from the user -->{
                if answer is true 
                if answer is false
            }
            block the button for the other user
            User answers
            score changes
            the question timers will restart and we move on to the next question 
            --------------------
The time should be managed globally so if the time is gone stop then it's stopped for all the users
